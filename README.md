At the last minute, you've been asked to work on team developing a module for an automated check-out system of a nationally-based grocery store chain. The module your team is building will accept two inputs: the total amount of the sale and the amount tendered by the customer. Then, it should calculate the amount of change due in dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies.

This change calculator efficiently outputs the number of dollars and coins to be outputted to a customer.
